# geo-spatial-map--leaflet

Using the leaflet library make an interactive leaflet map of an area of your choosing with the following guidlines:

(1) Must have a tiles-layer (basemap)

(2) Must import a real local geojson file. Can be points, polygons, etc.  You can use census data or any other geojson you can find or create one on your own of lets say pizza shops using something google maps or the openstreetmaps base layer to mark coordinates.

(3) Should have some interactive elements such as a clickable or hover type popup or other interesting element.

OPTIONAL: Make a d3 visualization: line chart, bar chart, heatmap inside a leaflet popup
